Description: Tools for the evaluation of interim analysis plans for sequentially
 monitored trials on a survival endpoint; tools to construct efficacy and 
 futility boundaries, for deriving power of a sequential design at a specified
 alternative, template for evaluating the performance of candidate plans at a 
 set of time varying alternatives. See Izmirlian, G. (2014) <doi:10.4310/SII.2014.v7.n1.a4>.
